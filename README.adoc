== Usage
In order to use the dummy printer you simply have to put the library on your class path.
From this point on you will find a least one printer `dummyPrinter` and therefore a default printer even you
do not have any actual printer installed.

In the case where printers have been installed you find an additional `dummyPrinter` too.

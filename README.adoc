== Usage
In order to use the virtual printer you simply have to put the library on your class path.
From this point on you will find a least one printer `VirtualPrinter` and therefore a default printer even you
do not have any actual printer installed.

In the case where printers have been installed you find an additional `VirtualPrinter` too.
